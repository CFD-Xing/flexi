# Tutorials \label{chap:tutorials}

This chapter will give a detailed overview of flow simulations with **FLEXI**. It assumes that you are familiar with how to set the compiler options and how to compile the code. The path to all executables is omitted. It is assumed that you either added aliases for **flexi**, **hopr** and all posti tools, or that you added the binary directories to your `$PATH` variable as described in \ref{sec:compilingthecode}. 

Each tutorial is equipped with .ini files *parameter_hopr.ini*, *parameter_flexi.ini*, *parameter_postiVisu.ini* as well as mesh file *\*\_mesh.h5* in HDF5 format (created with **HOPR**).

~~~~~~
parameter_hopr.ini
parameter_flexi.ini
parameter_postiVisu.ini
mesh.h5
~~~~~~
 
We suggest to copy each folder to a new directory, where you can run and modify the "INI-files".
